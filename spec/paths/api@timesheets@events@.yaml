        Once a Timesheet event has been added it cannot be modified. Use this endpoint to upload real time timesheets, typically this would be to let Adi know about events as they happen.


        Creating or updating an inprogress timesheet is done by event.


        The events will need to be completed in a logical order. Starting a new shift will close any open shifts for that staff member


        Break start can only be followed by break finish


        Break finish can be followed by shift finish or change job.


        Shift start and change job can be followed by shift finish, break start or job change


        There is currently a limit to one break per shift. If you require multiple breaks you will need to create a new shift for any secondary breaks.
